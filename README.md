# Pong - Python

A project from 100 days of Code from Udemy <br />
Just a simple pong game but, instead of taking hints from the videos in the tutorial, I tried to do it on my own and thankfully I was able to finish it, while only checking for hints once (for the mov't of the ball when it bounces from the wall)
<br />
<br />
It was made using the Turtle module. <br />
Player 1 - left side; uses the W and S keys <br />
Player 2 - right side; uses the Up and Down arrow <br />
Button presses only register per press and not by holding the button down; a limitation I noticed while testing the game, holding a button down prevents another key press from being registered.
